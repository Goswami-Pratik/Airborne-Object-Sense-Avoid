                    <p>
                        Across the globe, demand for a cheap, reliable, and swift mode of transportation is in desperate need.
                        Various companies such as Amazon have introduced ‚Äúamazon prime air‚Äù services that aim to take advantage
                        of unmanned drone flights to deliver (Drone Delivery ‚Äì The Future of Logistics | Bray Solutions, 2017).
                        The extensive usage of drones in the commercial, agricultural, and military sectors (Commercial Drones:
                        A Guide to the Top Models on the Market, 2020) has resulted in an increased demand for autonomous drones.
                        The current drone sales surpassed $1.25 billion as of 2020 and are expected to grow to $63.6 billion by 2025.
                        According to business insiders, the market is predicted to sell 2.4 million by 2023 ‚Äì an increase of
                        66.8% and in the agricultural sector, the consumption is predicted to rise by 69% between 2010 to 2050
                        (Intelligence Insider, 2021). However, drones lack sense and avoidance capabilities which are crucial
                        for drones to be able to detect and track airborne objects observed in a planned flight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays drones use a range of expensive sensors such as LIDAR, infrared triangulation, lasers, and
                        passive acoustic sensors (for ultrasound). Solving the problem using only a single monocular video feed
                        ‚Äì from visual cameras, is very attractive as cameras are very lightweight and much cheaper to produce.
                        Tesla and other car manufacturers presently have an implementation of sense and avoid in their self-drive
                        autopilot systems (Autopilot | Tesla UK, 2016), which uses a set of camera and computer vision models
                        to improve road safety to avoid accidents and help to navigate to the destination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project aims to build an airborne object tracking system that will allow drones to sense and avoid
                        obstacles in an autonomous flight. Due to the weight and battery performance constraints, drones lack
                        safety-critical features such as a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) (Erwin Tracy, 2015),
                        therefore air traffic controllers (ATC) can‚Äôt actively monitor drones in uncontrolled airspace.
                        The airspace is relatively sparse and there is still a chance that a drone will encounter unforeseen
                        object/static object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The objective of the project is to take an image or a monocular video feed and to perform image
                        analysis to detect any airborne object in the video frame. The detected object then will be classified
                        and tracked throughout multiple frames, where eventually the model will use various factors
                        and a decision tree. Upon further decision making the model will perform
                        the necessary manoeuvre to create a safer route.

                        The project aim is to create a model that will take an image or a monocular video feed, then detect
                        any airborne object that could potentially collide with our object by tracking its motion across
                        multiple frames. Below are the set objectives that I will need to accomplish.
